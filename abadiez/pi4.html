              The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that
              plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard

              all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in
              languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing
              everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing
              the internet and playing high-definition video, to making
              spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

                Of course a Pi will not be the same experience as having a regular Windows
                PC or an iMac. The operating system, <b>Pi OS</b> (formerly
                Raspbian), is based on a version of Linux called <b>Debian</b>. It
                comes with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) so it does look like
                a regular PC but that’s the closest of a similarity it can get.
                Most of the operations are done via a black-screen terminal and
                I had to forget all of the conveniences I am used to, like using a mouse for navigation,
                inserting a usb drive with plug-and-play experience, and
                having a  Google Chrome as browser.
              </p>
              <p class="pi4__text">
                I have no prior experience with Linux and the last coding
                language I learned was C back in high school. So I spent a lot
                of time scouring the internet for <b>DIY guides</b> (thank you
                <a href="https://pimylifeup.com" target="_blank"

                No two Pi set-ups are
                exactly alike and every so often I get an <b>error code</b> that is
                so obscure that the last person who had the same experience
                posted his problem ages ago with no proper resolution. Either
                he figured it out on his own and didn’t bother to update his log
                or he just gave up in frustration and threw his Pi out the
                window. </p>
                <p class="pi4__text">I needed <b>patience</b>, a boat-load of patience,
                because one incorrect configuration could make the Pi go haywire
                and might require a last-resort reformat. Worst thing that happened to 
                me was losing internet connectivity for 4 hours and missed an important online appointment!

                The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and
                maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems
                including UNIX and Windows. The goal of this project is to
                provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides
                HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.

                This website is hosted entirely by a Raspberry Pi running <b>24/7</b>
                in my closet. You may be wondering how that adds to my electricity 
                bill so let’s try to work that out.
              </p>

                <p class="pi4__text">
                When running at 100% load x 4 CPUs, the Pi 4 is rated to consume
                6.4 W or 154 Wh daily. In Japan that translates to <b>92 yen</b> or about
                <b>US$ 0.85</b> of additional electricity charge per month. Note that this is assuming all cores of the CPU are running at 100%
                load which is not the case if you are using the Pi as
                a server since it will mostly be on idle. My average CPU load
                with applications running in the background does not go beyond
                10%. 
                </p>
                <p class="pi4__text">
                  <b>Bottomline:</b> you won’t notice any increase on your
                  electricity bill.

              <p class="pi4__comp">
                Homebridge allows the integration of smart home devices that do
                not natively support Apple HomeKit. There are over 2,000
                available plugins supporting thousands of different smart
                accessories.
              </p>
              <p class="pi4__text">
                Apple’s home automation app, <b>HomeKit</b>, is one of the best when it
                comes to user interface but it supports only a handful of smart home
                devices. Homebridge acts as a middleman or more aptly, a
                bridge, so I can control non-Apple-certified devices
                with my <em>iPhone</em>, including <em>Siri Shortcuts</em>.

              <p class="pi4__comp">
                Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use
                OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called
                containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle
                their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can
                communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
              </p>
              <p class="pi4__text">
                Having my Pi host multiple servers breeds a lot of
                complications. One way to avoid having one application mess up
                another is to create separate <b>containers</b> within Docker and have
                these processes run independently. In case I screw up on a
                configuration and need a fresh start, deleting and reinstalling
                a container is really convenient.
              </p>

              <p class="pi4__comp">
                The Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from

              <p class="pi4__text">
                When you input a site like <em>google.com</em> on your browser, you are
                instructing your computer to connect to that website’s host.
                Since your computer can only communicate with 1s and 0s,
                the site name <em>google.com</em> needs to be translated to an IP address or 
                <b>172.217.175.78</b> (at the time of writing). You can get the IP address
                of any website via a terminal with the command ping [space] website.
              </p>
              <img src="pi4-ping.PNG" alt="" />
              <p class="pi4__text">
                If you input the IP address directly on your browser, it would
                yield the same result as if you typed in the domain name. But
                who can remember <b>172.217.175.78</b> better than <em>google.com</em>?
              </p>
              <p class="pi4__text">
                A <b>Domain Name Server</b> (DNS), as the name suggests, contains a directory
                of all websites and their corresponding IP address. Think something like a
                very thick yellow pages phone book or the Contacts app on your phone if you're from a younger generation.

              <p class="pi4__text">
                Pi-hole acts as a DNS for my local network. So whenever I want to access
                a website on my browser, my Pi would be the first point of contact and it will <b>block</b> incoming
                traffic from any blacklisted domains, which are mostly <b>ad sites</b>. Without
                the need to load ads, my browsing experience becomes a liitle bit faster and significantly
                less annoying.

                Postfix is a free and open-source mail transfer agent that
                routes and delivers electronic mail while Dovecot is an IMAP and
                POP3 server supporting the standard mbox and Maildir formats.
              </p>
              <p class="pi4__text">
                I can send and receive <b>emails</b> through my Pi without the need of
                a mailhost like <em>gmail</em> or <em>yahoomail</em> (anyone still uses this?). I can also
                personalize an email address using any customized domain I own,
                for example <b>info@abadiez.com</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="pi4__text">
                Through the combination of Postfix as my <b>outgoing agent</b> and
                Dovecot as my <b>incoming server</b>, I can access my personalized email account via any
                application and on any device that uses IMAP and POP3 like the
                Mail app on an <em>Iphone</em>, <em>Thunderbird </em>on a desktop, and so on.
              </p>
              <p class="pi4__text">
                Sounds awesome? Well, it can get complicated. Since my
                Pi is acting as a mail server, I need to protect it from
                spammers and phishers on my own so additional setups like <b>TLS
                encryption </b>and reverse DNS become absolutely necessary.
